## About The Project

This project is a mini web application that demonstrates the functionality of Javascript in web applications.

The project is a football scout management mini web application that is set to take the sport to the next level. The web app is managed by NexGen scouting agencies with the aim of giving oportunities to the young football talents of this generation to make a name for themselves by linking them up with the big and elite teams. The agency will have the ability to add players to the web interface and the big team representatives will get a chance to study the young talents and choose those that meet their requirements of maybe age, position of play,etc.
The agency will also be able to edit the players details from time to time as they advance in their careers and delete players when they are no longer viable for selection.
